    Ada Lovelace


     What do you think are pathways or entry points to STEM-related fields that should be in place for all young women and girls? How can we help make them accessible?

     Shared family science experience 

     Science center field trips - varied, hands on activities providing entry points for lots of different kinds of learners

     Family STEAM Nights/community events

    Flubber

    Chad: I want web flubber.

    MaKey Makey - https://twitter.com/daniellecrobins/status/784842547742986240

    3D printers

    Hack space - informal entry point - see people in action

    Drop-in

    Makerspaces w/ access to a wide variety of resources. 

    Intersecting hobbies and interests with Science can hook girls for science 

    Finding ways to link hobbies in our everyday interests to science 

    June: "affirm that students are doing great science, even when they are not realizing they are"

     How did you get where you are today? What was your journey like (who helped you, what entry point did you take advantage of, what challenges did you face)?

     TEACHERS! I realized that the teachers who I found inspiring were a big cause of the courses/fields I loved 

    Community college! I was inspired to get into research by inspiringfaculty at Laguardia Community College CUNY NYC!

     My internet friends! They encouraged me a lot keep learning because they helped me believe I can do great things

     

    Do you have any favorite Ada Lovelace Day blog posts that you've written or read? Teaching and learning resources? If so, where can we find them?

     Resource: A new alternate reality game focused on computational thinking, featuring Ada Lovelace: http://thetessera.org/ SOOOOO COOOL! +1 Does it launch later this month? YES! :-) Science & Villians?!?! Awesome! Can you play it online only without the in person experience?Yes, you can play just online. They are separate games but go together if you have the opportunity to go to the museum. But the museum is not required, online only works as well.

    Alternate Reality Game - ARG - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game

    Computer History Museum - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_History_Museum

    Here's that workshop format: https://github.com/mozillascience/curriculum-design-workshop 

    plus one of the resources that we created using it: instructions to create a Climate Almanac: https://github.com/mozillascience/curriculum-design-workshop/blob/master/products/climate-almanac.md

     Questions from our audience:

    Do you have any recommendations for books, podcasts or movies about gender equality/women in tech/education? looking for some new reads ;)

    https://portraitofthescientist.wordpress.com/ <- blog from anonymous women in science+1

    Call your girlfriend http://www.callyourgirlfriend.com/  is a fun one+1


    Has anyone got top tips for attracting and retaining girls in STEM - particularly teenagers!!? Specifically in computer programming- where we are operating.

    Connect with larger networks like WomenWhoCode and ChickTech, building a supportive network is key! In My city PyLadies also runs super friendly CLI bootcamp, python basics, etc, in a women-only environment <- a great way to meet mentors in the field! +1 getting them involved or introducing them to local groups that support girls in STEM. OR creating your own locally.


     Mentors! Providing and continuously showing them more mentors in different fields who can answers questions they have . +1 for Mentors!+1

    I think we can organize events with themes related to current hobbies of girls to get attracted, show them the kind of tools they can use and prototype: magazines, videogames, apps, characters, robots, DIY material with science, etc. Also get a long with mentors guiding them trough this path of prototyping

    MIT App inventor: http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ This is a fun intro!

    bubblesort zines http://bubblesort-zines.myshopify.com/ Awesome - writing a guide for our volunteers so the talks sound great :)

    https://www.alterconf.com/speakers/amy-wibowo  <- talk is called coding like a girl! I think it's important not to de-feminize things, if the teen girls are identifying with cute/fun things, they can do that and also be amazing coders



    3. 9:20 - 9:25 AM ET - Deciding on a project (or projects) we can prototype together. 

    I'd be interested in creating some experience or lesson that helps learners connect everyday skills or activities with science skills+1+1+1+1 like how arts and crafts relate to science (quilts, knitting, etc.)

    I also think it would be cool and probably challenging to create materials about how we understand time: scope, scale, how we observe and record: from geologic time to everyday time to cosmic time  (could include time lapse photo stuff, stop motion animation, etc)

    Internet flubber+1 what is flubber?+1

    Flubber - http://www.livecrafteat.com/craft/homemade-flubber-for-kids/

    Conversation-starters?

     Get Started Guide for inspiring young girls/women to get involved in Science for the 1st time   

    resources list

     Community event kit?+1 +1

    Women in STEM club or badges or something fun we can learn about each other with.+1



    4. 9:25 - 9:50 AM ET - Sprinting on prototypes and projects: 

    BIG IDEA: Experiences that connect everyday life and science

    You can connect an activity that lots of kids do: collecting toys, baseball cards or stickers, pokemon creatures, etc: to the kind of collecting and classifying that scientists do (I had a shell collection when I was little that I spent tons of time organizing, but I never made the connection between features and species and environmental conditions that the shell came from)

    Very cool - like a nomenclature, sorting, algorithmic set of activities? yeah! 

    Awesome. What would a set of steps or instructions be (super lightweight) for sotrting in different ways or pattern-hunting? What would you ask a learner to do first?

    STEPS:

    Take your collection out and spread it out so you can see everything you have at once

    Take one item and examine it:

    what kinds of things can you observe about it (shape, color, size, markings, etc)-- these are features

    make a list of common features in your collection

    begin to arrange or organize your collection by a single feature

    are their some items that have unique features? what makes some items seem more similar to others?

    Other kinds of experiments to run on sets? 

    DATA SETS FOR ALL.

     You can also take your collection and experiment with visualizing it-- mapping or graphing it by features.+1+1

    maybe some kind of online or interactive data collection? to introduce the idea of a scientific community around the world?

    Collecting data in their neighborhood and adding to a larger web-based project

    weather data

    plant data - post picture of plants described as weeds - what is a weed aroudn the world?

    data about their school

    Breakfast data - what is breakfast in their family

    virtual breaking bread & data collection w/ ppl around the world sounds awesome<-YES

    Favorite toy

    Bird Data-http://content.yardmap.org/learn/2016_gbbc/+1

     A Brainstorm: An activity structure for parents and young children: (great set of prompts)

    Do an activity together (e.g., go to the zoo, pick up leaves on a walk around the block, play a video game together)

    Read Leaf Man, collect leaves, create a collage, try to identify the trees. +1

    Have a chat about the experience -- what did we like? what was fun? what did we notice/observe? why was it cool? what do we think happened/was happening? why do we think that happened or did not happen? What questions do we have?

    Like a reverse-engineering conversation about something that happened or was made?

    Do a craft or art project or any kind of maker project, making something from the experience - Make! Express! Tell a story! +1

    Is there a template or frame you'd use? Could we make one on our code editor (Thimble, https://thimble.mozilla.org ) that people can remix for their outings. collections, etc? I think this is a wonderful idea

    Look up information about the questions we still have together, online. Find info together to learn content knowledge.

    Link the experience to literacy -- e.g., maybe talk about a key word in the experience and practice spelling the word  +1

    Ask the children what other things they are now wondering about... think about a new experience to jumpstart that new interest

     Activities that highlight observation and questioning

    Great connection to some of the suggestions above - hack there, too?

    I've seen lots of projects that create art or build things based on math and science principles - for example, making playing cards based on the periodical table or sewing mathematical equations into fabric. 

    I saw a periodic table battleship type game. http://teachbesideme.com/periodic-table-battleship/ cool! 

    Yes - I've seen similar work with bead patterns on jewelry. Any favorite links or steps you'd suggest?Looking for some online, but just saw this pretty article about the relationship between art, math and science https://medium.com/@sailorhg/art-and-math-and-science-oh-my-f1dc4ebb3223#.40xikjmzc so good! + art <3 it

    Also, here are a bunch of cool activities for kids http://www.whatdowedoallday.com/2015/07/explore-and-create-science-art-projects.html

    Wasn't able to attend, but in my city there was a Maker Faire that brought people across the city together to share their projects. Really cool way to learn about new things and also inspire others: http://sandiego.makerfaire.com/ +1+1

    Here in Mexico we do Maker Labs with fun activities related with easy DIY projects

    http://dollarstorecrafts.com/2015/05/tutorial-diy-geodes/ i love geodes 

    https://gosciencegirls.com/glowing-ice-cubes-edible-sensory-science-play/

    https://gosciencegirls.com/fluorescent-slime/ This is like flubber yes!

    The hardest thing for Science Hack Day was getting people to understand the point of an interdisciplinary event and take it seriously. ONce people were on board, it totally worked. +1 Having the serious scientitsts and engineers there was critical, but plenty of people who would have been great didn't come because they didn't get it, or wrote it off as "outreach" but whatever, we got 100 people :)


    5. 9:50 AM - 9:00 PM ET - Sharing prototypes and reflections on the sprint.

     See above - great ideas!

    6. 10:00 PM ET - Final thoughts, ways to keep in touch, and good-byes.

     Thank you everyone! Great line up of guests today. 

     Thanks everyone! I've learned a lot today from everyone.

     Thank you! I really enjoyed this format!! keep in touch @daniellecrobins on twitter-You're amazing and sparkly yay! sparkle fingers

    June: we are all gatekeepers when we are educators 

    It's okay to be sparkly and be a badass scientist + a million yesss

    I am following all y'all on twitter now - YES. :)
