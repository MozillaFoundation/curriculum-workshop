**Lainie**: 20:11 Hi all! the shortlink for this page (in case you want to share) is http://mzl.la/curriculumworkshop

**Paul Allison**: 20:12 Hi all.

**Paul**: 20:13 Hey Paul Allison! Welcome friend.

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:17 Generally Assembly is an awesome place

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:17 General

**Paul**: 20:18 Can you say more about General Assembly Laira - I'm not familiar with it

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:18 It is a website in which one can learn coding like css for Web design.

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:19 https://generalassemb.ly

**Paul**: 20:19 got it - thnx!

**Paul Allison**: 20:22 Love the action-orientation here.

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:24 The closest I have is that we have been using the engineering design process to somewhat backwards engineer the thought process in creating the products they are interested in. This requires us to do online research and development

**Paul Allison**: 20:24 Has anybody figured out how to live-stream on Youtube yet?

**Paul Allison**: 20:24 I'd love for my students to be able to use that to record their work for self-assessment.

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:24 We are also working on creating Google Sites for them to be able to share their progress on projects and designs they have

**Julia, Hive NYC**: 20:25 someone was telling me how they have their students screen cast their projects today

**Paul**: 20:25 love that idea Julia

**Julia, Hive NYC**: 20:25 so they can put them online without having to livestream

**Amira**: 20:26 @julia - I wonder who see's them and what type of feedback they get from it

**Paul Allison**: 20:26 Yeah... but I just noticed that Youtube is allowing screencasting and recording, and that would make it soo... easy.

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:26 Being that NYCSPARX is part of NYC Parks and Recreation, we are limited in how we use media at times

**Julia, Hive NYC**: 20:26 Ihmm, that does sound easier

**Paul Allison**: 20:27 Set up wasn't so straightforward in the few minutes I gave it last night.

**Julia, Hive NYC**: 20:27 @amira as far as i know they are used to share with other students at different schools

**Julia, Hive NYC**: 20:27 so they can see each others projects

**Alicia**: 20:28 We have been very fortunate to have some ndustry leaders be our instructors for our workshops!

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:29 For project ideas, I try to have the girls work on ideas that help them.. By them..

**Claire Shorall**: 20:29 Where are you, @alicia?

**Alicia**: 20:29 Philadelphia

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:30 So I think it's a project that is solution based

**Claire Shorall**: 20:30 I wonder how this works for rural regions...

**Claire Shorall**: 20:30 I am also in a city, though

**Chris Lawrence**: 20:30 what if industry mentors produced assets for use quicker, like case studies for analysis, design frameworks, code

**Alicia**: 20:31 I agree.. it would be more difficult to get leaders on board in other areas.. but somebody always knows someone!

**Amira**: 20:32 What are the issues facing urban areas? lack of mentors? distance?

**Paul Allison**: 20:34 Does anybody know where we can see how young gamers share with each other using screencasting?

**Paul Allison**: 20:34 I'd like students to be able to share what they are doing in Minecraft with each other -- and with me -- better.

**chadsansing**: 20:35 The GDoc for prototyping:

**chadsansing**: 20:35 https://docs.google.com/document/d/13poudr6Tpg6dJBZHCNB1hk0a7egGaRAmsAQWgb4vQTU/edit?usp=sharing

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:35 Is there a short link?

**Paul Allison**: 20:36 Okay... I'll just look.

**Paul Allison**: 20:36 Thanks.

**Kristina**: 20:36 Try this Laira: http://mzl.la/1Lcdx2p

**Paul Allison**: 20:36 Love to see that.

**Julia, Hive NYC**: 20:37 good q Paul. GLobal Kids in NYC just did a cross city minecraft event with the realease of hungergames....they might have some good suggestions

**Julia, Hive NYC**: 20:38 http://hivenyc.wpengine.com/portfolio/hungercraft/

**Paul Allison**: 20:39 Got it. Thanks.

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:39 Thanks Kristina!

**Kristina**: 20:44 Is anyone having issues accessing the google document on line 46? Live prototyping happening there now!

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:45 Is there more than one doc?

**Lainie**: 20:47 One doc (same on linked on line 35) - one is long-form link, one is shortlink

**Kristina**: 20:47 correct, thanks purple unnamed!

**Kristina**: 20:47 (Please name yourself!)

**Lainie**: 20:48 Me, sorry!

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:48 Ohhhh okay.. I am there

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:51 I have the girls in my group working towards creating a chat app for Android in which they can chat togther

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:51 This way they can take ownership over something they use everyday, so to speak

**Kristina**: 20:51 sounds like a great project and very relevant to this discussion. Would love for you to loop back with us as you experience and finalze it

**Kristina**: 20:52 Perhaps on discourse?

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:52 Sure! The Mozilla discourse?

**Kristina**: 20:53 Yeah, you can post to the threads on line 49/50 . Where it makes sense

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:54 I see.. The link now lol

**Julia, Hive NYC**: 20:56 also very curious/interested in empowering people to be mentors that may not think they have the experience to be. Can we create a resource to help people who might be "mentor curious"?

**Alicia**: 20:56 I am the curriculum developer for TechGirlz Non-profit in Philly.. we run a 5 day Entrepreneur Summer Camp

**Kim Wilkens**: 20:58 @Alicia - added TechGirlz resources in Gdoc

**Alicia**: 20:58 This gets students involved in creating apps for ideas they have by working with Developers in the area and then pitching their ideas to real Founders. You can find the plans online at TechGirlz.org for anyone to use and run a camp!

**Alicia**: 20:59 oh great thanks @Kim

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 20:59 Bye!

**Hana, Hive NYC**: 21:00 Thanks everyone!

**Laira - NYCSPARX** : 21:00 Lairareid.crc@gmail.com or Sparx.crc@gmail.com

**Katie** : 21:01 Thank y'all!

**chadsansing**: 21:16 Thank you and good-night, wonderful participants. Keep adding to the MoPad and docs!
