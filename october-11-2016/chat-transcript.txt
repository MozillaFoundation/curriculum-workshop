Cristol Kapp:09:46 Students spend a portion of their day outside making observations

Cristol Kapp:09:46 asking questions, etc.

Cristol Kapp:09:47 There were so many butterflies, that the teacher decided to study butterfly life cycles. Students can now identify 10 different butterflies that are in the forest...
