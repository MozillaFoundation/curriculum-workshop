**2. 2:10 - 2:20 PM GMT - Questions & Answers**

- page 4 defintion of brokering: 
-       Connect youth to meaningful future learning opportunities including events, programs, internships, individuals and institutions that will support youth in continuing their interest-driven learning. 
-       Enrich their social networks with adults, peers, and institutions that are connected to/have knowledge of future learning opportunities.YAS! Thanks greg 
-       src: https://via.hypothes.is/hivenyc.org/wp-content/uploads/Hive-Research-Lab-2015-Community-White-Paper-Brokering-Future-Learning-Opportunities.pdf
- When you broker a learning opportunity, you show a learner why the topic is relevant to them and help them to take advantage of it. What kinds of web literacy opportunities do you broker for local learners? How do you connect young people to opportunities to learn about the web and use it in their daily lives?
-       Brenda: Important to gain trust and move forward based on what your learners need to be/feel successful. May be for life outside of the program, which is a comfort zone, and will need to push them a bit to move forward outside of the program
-       Make it interactive! hands-on fun activities are a great first step
-       Ani: Start with something physical-- build your way up to the computer. Sometimes this does not seem directly related to "learning to code" or "digital citizenship," but it helps us get to what Brenda was talking about- Trust and Respect +1000+1 also physical stuff is FUN
-       Mmaki: Club Captains who come from the same community as the learners, seen as a reflection of themselves and create a more comfortable, trusting atmosphere. If the learners see the opportunities and resources used by the leaders they will be more empowered to use them ourselves+100 demonstrate by example - role models and mentors :)
-       Helping them to relate technology benefits to their everyday lives
-       Julia: I usually start by asking what they want to do or learn.....or what they want to do when they "grow up". Then start a conversation about opportunities that exist to get them there - I love to point to cool sites and information on the web as well to give examples of what is out there and where to find it. +1
-       contextual problems and relations @mmaki yes! contextualize learning!
-       I am finding self reflective activities to be some of the first brokering I do. My club members need to see how they can be empowered by the web instead of mystified.
-       We have also connected to elections, blacklivesmatter, and getting to college+1 current issues are great for setting a context for technology+1
-       Help people see themselves as participants +1 (on the web, in STEAM, as designers and engineers). They can't be expected to see the relevance if no one doing the work looks like them. Sometimes that means flipping the language or going into the deep cuts of the work. 
-       Arko: Started with setting up a Club was the 1st step to starting Hello Web but it moved to using many resources +1
-       arko: how the web can make your life easier+1
- How did you become a “broker” for web literacy learning? What are the important experiences and lessons you learned that help you do this work or could help others do this work?
-       Mmaki: skills of tech extend beyond the courses that are taught and be used throughout many communities and schools. She used the platform by reaching out to schools and asking if her group can speak in their school to benefit the community (some schools have more space for example which is useful for many programs)
-       Learn out loud. Record and share everything you learn, the issues you face, challenges you overcome.
-       I was working at a STEAM focused space that was rooted in confidence building. +1Confidence was our cornerstone. Anyway, when I got my job at Sprout, I had to drill down into digital literacy and really look at what that meant for our region. Plus, my first real week at work was MozFest, so that helped
-       Design more inclusive spaces some words and designs in tech not as friendly as we think (ninja, 24 hour crazy hackjams).
-       Brenda: HS art teacher for a few years and with that background, the thought of "how do we better prepare the students for their futures" is always in mind.  Youth doesn't really have the option to join the digital world, so we need to teach conscious decisions to be responsible with it+1
-       How do we help youth to become more conscious of their digital lives - prototyping idea
-       So much to dig into-- Demystify the Web session please (like that cool session about "I work on the web" last year) 
-       Arko: Gathering all resources by the leaders is a great start (space, online tools, topics, etc.) Requests can be made based on needs and opportunities through resources
-       Paying sessions forward - up-voting effective practices by adopting and using demo materials - prototyping idea.
- What challenges and opportunities for youth learning do you, your community, and young people face where you live? How do you know when this is working?

-       Brenda: studen becomes the teacher- youth show new ways approaches they broker opportunities for you -That is the ultimate goal
-       Mmaki: when listening to club captains to facilitate clubs, we can promote specific, important topics (i.e. tailoring programs to girls). Using daily examples to link it back to technology has been really useful, solid aha moments (email explanations)
-       I constantly struggle to communicate to people that digital literacy is not rooted in learning to code. It's so far from that. Agree code is another way of organizing text. Organizing learners thats the real challenge yea, it's just the means to the end. 
-       Arko: Web Literacy is very small rate and the internet does not reach every part of the country. Open source goals and web literacy campaigns are key and successful +1
-       India is a developing country. Web literacy rate is roughly 8%. The internet has not reached every nook and corner of the country as people are still dying of hunger and famine. Thus, in a country like ours, the Government is busy keeping people alive and healthy, the web is not their main concern. In a situation like this, it is extremely challenging to emphasise on the importance of web literacy which is extremely important for the development and future of the country.
-       However, the best part about the nation is that it has motivated individuals who are ready to give up their own pleasures towards the upliftment of fellow human beings. It is this motivation and dedication which acts as the biggest strength for Mozillians and push them to go the extra mile in achieving their goal of a web literate nation. (woah) +1000
-  Questions from our audience:
-       Arko, what are some of the first learning moments you see with #helloweb participants you work with? and how do you follow up with them to turn that learning moment into an ongoing and deep learning experience? In india web literacy rate is 8% and not reached the city, government is not worried about internet 
-       Mozilla has always stood for free flow of information, let us take a step ahead with a specially streamlined information exchange platform for a better exchange of knowledge
-       While Mozilla events are held across the globe, a lot of times there are members of the community who have questions that often go unanswered for various unprecedented reasons. We need to build a stronger network system where not one member of the community is left in doubt and the leaders of the community can reach out to everyone individually

**3. 2:20 - 2:25 PM GMT - Deciding on a project (or projects) we can prototype together.** 

- how do we get youth to become more conscious of their digital lives+1 LOVE THIS ONE. Easy to implement and super useful ...and more conscious of their agency to shape those digital lives+yesbe fun
- ^this stems from the idea that if they're more conscious then they will be authentically engaged in those opportunities offered....+1twinkle fingers+1
- What do the internet gods look like?HA! <3+1 YES!+1
- Ways to up-vote effective demos and sessions through adoption/uptake/use by others. Coming up with steps and how people can see web literacy in action. Can we use a planet for that?Or do we just make a subreddit for now
- Chad did a great prototyping exercise of a game that might be fun to hack on: "What if they had the web?"  We should try this in the future.  The idea: present a scenario from fiction or real life and consider how that scenario might have gone differently if the people involved in the scenario had been able to use / better use the web to improve that scenario.
- Start a reading club across clubs. We can begin by first Jigsawing the global web ltieracy reports, then read "Its Complicated"
- Mozilla has always stood for free flow of information, let us take a step ahead with a specially streamlined information exchange platform for a better exchange of knowledge
- While Mozilla events are held across the globe, a lot of times there are members of the community who have questions that often go unanswered for various unprecedented reasons. We need to build a stronger network system where not one member of the community is left in doubt and the leaders of the community can reach out to everyone individually
- Create a guide on blogging as a club, or expand to digital presence of a club wso we can talk about all of the channels A Club guide for blogging exists! mozilla.github.io/learning-networks/clubs/marketing-your-mozilla-club-writing-a-blog/I think we should encourage through monthly challenges. I tried but it fizzled after two months...but it wasn't club driven
- I also like the Why we use the web activity (link please?)https://chadsansing.github.io/curriculum-testing/curriculum-migration/web-lit-basics-two-migrated/session01-why-do-we-use-the-web.html#overview (ty)it is part of web basics II curriculum)+1
- A database or simple map of resources that are available in your cities or neighborhoods. Example: New York City provide free video development (filming, editing, interview skills) courses for residents.   we did have the weblitmapper for a hot minute
- A storytelling task i.e. through remix glasses or an app, or a blog space that allows participants to write a story about their experiences linked to what they are learning. 
- We could also pick a suggested time frame for clubs to complete a module so we can then share the stories and learnings, have global connections, possibly facilitators

**4. 2:25 - 2:50 PM GMT - Sprinting on prototypes and projects:**

***Our Big Idea: How do we help youth become more aware of their digital lives and opportunities?***

- A time lapse or visual timeline showing the impact your digital presence has on your life - from youth through adulthood. Show how choices you make online impact the trajectory of your life.+100 Love this idea. Can also be an interactive story, (with choices that determine whats next)timelinejs is in awesome tool for this+1https://timeline.knightlab.com/
- I really like this video- https://www.commonsensemedia.org/videos/digital-footprint love adding media to learning
- Link back the resources to the greater community and benefits them. It makes a big difference of their contribution in contest+1+1
- this point is great and it also speaks to ways to inspire youth to have immediate impact in their communities. 
- Well we can have a Wall with two sections.< cool! Arko, is there a link to where this is online? Curious to see it
- Show digital footprint online - can we use lightbeam or something??? 
- I wonder if augemented reality can be a curious hook to begin the conversation.?? 
- have you seen this series on understanding your digital footprint: https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/tech-matters/2014/01/data-privacy-day-understanding-your-digital-footprints 
- Youth can think about what their grandparents value from family heirlooms versus the products they create on SnapChat and other social media. 
- Suggested Activity: Two people form a pair. Person 1 reviews someone's internet footprint or social media and tell a story with this information. Get pair to share what they think of each other's impressions based on internet footprint or social impression. Some questions to consider are: 1) Are these snapshots of someone's life accurate?  2) What is missing? 3) Is it flattering? 4) What would you like to change?
- Another suggestion is to do same activity with a celebrity or fake person.
- Discuss "digital rights" or ethics of changing a poem, painting, or a personal photo online with youth. 
- Kids draw a picture and pass it around. As their drawing dramatically change from student to student, ask students how they feel about end result. Are they happy with final product? How do they feel about change? Do they appreciate input from friends? How does collaborative artwork different than personal or individual artwork?
- Why do rights exist on paper but not online?
- Make an About Me page: https://thimbleprojects.org/jgmac1106/50872/

- **A. WHAT WE CAN OFFER!**
-        Club leaders get  an opportunity to answer questions thrown at them from across the globe
-       Mozilla club leaders will be segregated categorically. The answers to queries can be given by any club member, given that it has been approved by the club leader
-       Apart from answering queries, a team will work on building a Mozilla library for the benefit of Mozillians, thus adding to the  database

- **B. WHAT DO YOU NEED?**
-       Any registered Mozillian can put up questions on this side of the wall
-       Any Mozillian can request for any queries, PPTs, topic, demos, etc.
-       Once the answers are provided, it will be recorded in the archives that can then be used freely by any registered Mozillian for reference

- Maybe we develop a list of Guiding questions to use when curious moments happen? Themed by media/content area? I like this. Can we start a list here:
-       WHY?
-       Find the origins of that media? Who really created it

- What do youth NOT know about their online presence?
-       Brenda: Google maps to find people. Does everyone know that they are online (sometimes without a choice)
-         How can we take advantage of games like Pokemon go where people are finding connections in the real world through media
-       Mmaki: 8 year old son took photo and wanted to use it as a profile picture. People can access and do whatever they want with the pic. No one had told him so he didn't know! Take advantage of the small curious interests of youth to teach them. 
-       Also showing how people can get fired through what they say online and showing youth the power of your online life and profile. 
-       The death of the browser, right? Like, even the simplicity of mobile absorbing that original purpose. That's fascinating, but not necessarily accessible yet. (What do i mean.. umm) like, the internet isn't facebook or snapchat, but ... it IS for so many people. Also, at some point, we do need to learn to code in order to remain literate, but we treat it like science/math instead of language or we just treat it like language and not science/math, but its a crazy hybrid and i think that has a ton of potential 
-       I also love this idea around "Networked Media" and helping people think of the internet that way; video, links, text, images, mashup, remix, share, shoutout, clapback, advocate, protest, etc. So, the internet as a material for expression (art/culture) and learning as a 'biproduct". Making it about play. And calling it Brand as an engagement strategy. What's your brand?
-       Amira: many people that google themselves don't realize that there is info that already exists out there
-  How does video show up in all of this?
-       Brenda: most kids use youtube for almost everything. You like consuming this, how do you become a producer?
-       Mmaki: Depends on the role you want it to play. One challenge is to use a phone to create videos and the put the videos on youtube. They will forever be there so is a great opportunity to teach the digital footprint/responsibility discussion+1
-       It is the place where I find most want to begin. When

During this time, though we'll begin prototyping on this etherpad. The emphasis will be on talking with one another about the work so viewers can watch and listen to the process of curriculum and learning material 

**5. 2:50 - 3:00 PM GMT - Sharing prototypes and reflections on the sprint.**

- TAKE ADVANTAGE OF Aha! MOMENTS ACTIVITIES:
-       wht happens when you google yourself?
-       what happens to your photo once you share it?
-       Try tracking the origins of a popular online photo? Where did it really come from!
-       one tool that a hive nyc member uses is illuminus (https://illuminus.io/en/), which generates a personality assessment of people based on what they share on their facebook profile.  not 100% accurate, of course, but an interesting tool to get people, esp youth, to consider what they share online and what that content communicates about them to others.super interesting way to start a conversation....
-       GUIDING QUESTIONS: 
- 

**6. 3:00 PM GMT - Final thoughts, ways to keep in touch, and good-byes.**

- #whirlwind call & doc - thank you all!
- Thank you everyone . Cheers to the entire crew :) 
- Arko, we're going to have to join you on another call or in person whenever we can to hear more from you! I'm apologize about the connectivity today -
