**Amira:** *12:12* but everyone too! any questions?

**KimW:** *12:13* I see the resource divide issue too. We have some great programs for underprivileged, but they rarely interact with other programs, so no sharing across cultures

**Kevin:** *12:25* oopos... thought I did!

**Bud:** *12:30* Kevin - must it be the only tracking place?
