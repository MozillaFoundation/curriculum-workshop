**5:10 - 5:20 PM - Questions & Answers**

- Where you are in the world, what opportunities and challenges do you have in programming summer learning  or out-of-school learning? How do you use those opportunities and meet those challenges?
-       Su: main challenge is getting space to host events/sessions. Schools will likely only get student participants who attend that school (maybe territory issue?). Connectivity is an issue as well. Students can miss opportunities in the summer because they don't know it is there "thing"
-       Bud: lots of competition for space; geography - large distances between patrons and programs; difficult sometimes to connect those places online and build community, continuity between them.Opportunities: anything is doable!
-       Chris: uneven development, inequity between parts of the city in terms of accessibility, programming, resources; working on networking library branches and on networking branches to community orgs; competing with kids' other summer interests and opportunities need to be purposeful in summer programs

- What are some key characteristics of summer or out-of-school learning, and how can we help formal learning spaces like school classrooms adopt them?

-       Bud: people choose whether they want to get involved in summer learning, there is freedom and they are here if they want to be
-        In formal learning spaces, we need to engage the learners so they want to participate more. They may not have a choice regarding attending school, but they do exercise their choice regarding how much they care.
-       Su: More of a peer type of arrangement, lots more given and taken. There are varying ages and skill levels. We need to make programs participatory, really active, engaging - it's about teaching and embedding in that session and then building on it in the future. Digital Leaders: support teachers in the school, receive opportunities to attend relevant events/sessions, may be volunteer-based 
-       Chris: connecting experiences between where they are now and where they have come from - representing that connection with different forms of media can be really strong form of learning. Deeply engaging with identities is important but public schools aren't there yet. Urban gardening is a example to look to for vary skill levels and ages coming together to work. They are choosing to work together and are engaged and it works. Let's do that with tech! Don't force it, but take the opportunities to promote it and encourage
-       Bud: Building community in the learning space is key. Learn how to learn, learn how to be in a community with people, building mindsets: make sure these are bringing the community back to the purpose

- From our audience:

- How can we connect the learning that happened in informal spaces with the learning that happens in schools? When a student has learned something outside of school, how can we honor that in school?
-       we use badges to connect informal and formal learning within student portfolios. Hey devon! Great example - are the students motivated to achieve and share those badges?in our case, learning portfolios are shared by Ss in each community they are a part of, and connect interests to outcomes based on how Ss choose to represent themselves. OYO = own your own.. so kids have full control over data context of sharing and identity.
-       Bud: Making sure we aren't cheapening the experience by handing out honors/badges at only schools functions. It seems that only schools can dole out the learning kudos+1+1
-       Chris: "we are preparing you for the real world" says a teacher. Students are having "real world" experience at home so we need to address that reality.  DETROIT FUTURE SCHOOLS!!! http://www.detroitfutureschools.org/dfs-toolkit/
-       Su: Connection/communication between home and school/learning space is important but is a challenge. Unless the student tells the family what they learned, there is often no link.  I think if we really honor external learning in schools (even awarding credit...?), they would be far more likely to share their external experiences with us.
-       Bud: Show and tell can be so powerful!

- What if there was a peer to peer skill share that happens when students return to school? So they get to remember their learning but also to teach it
- Su, do the digital leaders apply? or are they self slecting? curious wha the framework is for getting participants. 
-         The digtital Leaders actually apply for the role.  They have interviews and can take part in a collaborative acitivity. I'm just hunting down a link...
          https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bw8rscVFZlaOMVdWWEtmZjl4WlE/edit
-       I see the resource / socioeconomic divide issue. We have some great programs in our city for underprivileged and for privileged, but they donâ€™t intersect, so I feel like this expands the cultural divide. Anybody having success bringing diverse groups together?
-       This is in regards to Christopher's (im so excited for this) Vietnamese refugee youth interviewing older folks in the community. A cooking show on YouTube: http://www.cookingwithgranny.tv/index.html. It combines generational exchange with food. Nice!!!This is such a rad idea +1000
-       Su: mentoring can be a great opportunity to get multi-ages/skill levels involved in a project
-       Bud: Posters help to engage folks, but personal invitations (via spending time with the people you want to participate) is really powerful. Bookmobiles aren't cool with HS kids any more, so we set up a "kiosk" of sorts to bring the books in from the bookmobile. Having a video game night had great turnout - let the teens plan an event so there is buy-in and relevance. We have to meet them where they are. 

**5:20 - 5:25 PM - Deciding on a project (or projects) we can prototype together.**

- a tool for helping communities to explore the passions of its members?
- protocols for sharing sessions?
- reflective tool or tools for people to help them self-direct?
- A tool or resource that shows where to find summer learning ops for youth - we try in NYC with a blog post, but it could be so much better http://hivenyc.org/2016/06/09/2016-summer-youth-programs/
- Digital quilt? Skill shares I'm looking for an example quilt to share what I was talking about!
- A hashtag for youth around the world to exchange summer outdoor games. Detailed instructions, visual examples like short clips on vine, photos are submitted. #summerofyouth #foreveryoung (ha!) YES! #digitalplayground #afterschoolspecial
- Summer tech activity challenge series!

**5:25 - 5:50 PM - Sprinting on prototypes and projects.**

We're going to build a convening and facilitation guide for hosting a summer learning event. It will include:

- Best practices for gathering youth together.
- Logistic practices for securing spaces, scheduling the day, and maybe even securing food and drink for the event.
- Facilitation tips for teaching and learning in participatory ways.
- An exemplar lesson or piece of content on making a digital quilt or other tpe of skill share between learners.
- Best practices for documenting the work and sharing it later.

**Things to do before: facilitation tips, etc. **

- locate a space - consider community spaces but also how you can take advantage of a space inside AND outside (it is summer afterall)
- recruit mentors and facilitators
- Decide on age range - teenagers may not be happy to work alongside younger pupils, but may be happy to Mentor (great for soft skills)
- Promote your event don't forget to include all of the information that your participants need
- Where, when, who, what, Why do they want to be there
- Check out the facilities, is the space appropriate, how many participants can you accommodate, do you have the tech and the skills that you need
- See what tech you can borrow from other institutions: some schools will be willing to loan equipment 
- For longer programmes, look into sponsor involvement, even if it's just providing some refreshments
- Ensure that you have all of the resources
- Create an Eventbrite event to manage and share it through social media.  
- Make sure that you provide your participants with all the information which they might need ahead of the event to make their time as great as it can be
- create event breadcrumbs, tantalizers ahead of the event to excite your participants
- Understand what resources you have. Before figuring out what you need. (in terms of networking community partners and organizations)
- Make posters and share them out n the community but also visit and see people in person so you can share the work with them Consider letting the students plan the invite (or at least help)
- Use social networks aka Twitter and FB to share info about your event. Also use Eventbrite  Do an assessment of where the audience is (might not be the go-to FB and twitter)
- Most cities and places have summer guides with info on events where it's free to add your event
- Get buy-in from the parents (if they say yes, then the student will likely be there!)
- look for partners - maybe the thing you think is a need is actually being done really, really well by someone else.  make friends with them. figure out how you can help

**Things to do during: (sharing, work time, content, etc.)**

-  Warm up/Starters 
- Establish norms right away - and model the habits and routines you want to see throughout the experience early on
- If writing/making is a thing you want to happen, make sure it happens early and often
- set clear goals for worktime before work begins - 
- establish sharing routines (digital quilt, etc.) 
- obtain delicious snacks for the first day - then ask participants to take turns sharing snacks after.  That always happens - and is another way to get folks to share themselves in some amazing ways
- Add lots of elements of hands-on and fun activities
- Really tap into their passions here, so they continue to engage
- Encourage makers to consider their audience/end user with their make so that when they share it with others they really feel that they have achieved... their audience will be more receptive to something that they understand, something which excites them Reminds me of the work of Youth Radio and collegial pedagogy!!! http://culturemediaed.pressible.org/files/2011/09/soepchavez.pdf
- Keep demonstrations or workshops short, give youth room to explore materials and learn from each other. 
- make things.  rinse.  repeat.

**Things to do after/or near the end**

- document along the way - publish the documentation so that it's shared
- collectively decide whats the most important part to share with others. might not be the final product!
- celebrate and invite others to engage with the work!+1
- Encourage sharing within the event/workshop as well as outside of it.  Provide means for sharing with the participants various external contacts (family, school etc...) several ways (to allow for audiences needs) but keep it manageable
- Digital tools aid the planning process for tactical or physical creations. How can we create a birdhouse without sketching out blueprint digitally or on paper?

During this time, though we'll begin prototyping on this etherpad. The emphasis will be on talking with one another about the work so viewers can watch and listen to the process of curriculum and learning material 

**5:50 - 6:00 PM - Sharing prototypes and reflections on the sprint.**

**6:00 PM - Final thoughts, ways to keep in touch, and good-byes.**
