**Physical Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT)**

**1. 8:00 - 8:10 - Introductions to the show, our on-air participants, and their work.**

- Jeremy Boggs, a design architect at the University of Virginia’s Scholars’ Lab, http://scholarslab.org/people/jeremy-boggs/
		
		- Will join us next time!

- Natalie Freed, a computer science and digital fabrication teacher at Lick-Wilmerding High School in San Francisco, CA, http://www.nataliefreed.com/

		- High school teacher (9-12 grade)
		- Started with educational technology research and the link between code and technology
		- Physical computing is digital and physical together. Tangible components so you can take something digital ad making it physical. 

- Andre Garzia, a Mozilla Clubs Regional Coordinator and educational technologist, http://andregarzia.com/pages/en/blog/

		- Works with web literacy, physical computing and lots of experimenting at Mozilla!
		- Physical computing is like lego blocks with technology; about making "dumb" physical every day objects smart!

- Jie Qi, a PhD student at the MIT Media Lab in the Responsive Environments group, http://technolojie.com/

		- Creative Director at Chibitronics- creates tools to integrate arts and crafts into tech
		- Physical computing is bringing things to life - they can sense my presence. +1

**2. 8:10 - 8:20 PM - Questions & Answers**

- What do educators need to know about physical computing and the Internet of Things? What's on the way? Why does it matter?

		- Natalie: We have devices that are even more portable and this is an opportunity to have ways to be connected without being glued to a screen. We don't need a company to decide how things work! Empowering us to make our own technology.
		- Jie: Off screen component - a sound or a light up from a place you don't expect is magical! It's not just engineers that can make this happen - anyone can do it! Sparking wonder and curiosity!+1 curiosity, I think that is huge for me More opportunities for wonder! yes (Magic, wonder, whimsy, tangible magic- some great adjectives for this work) 

- Does anyone remember a moment when they had a magical moment with technology?

		- Those moments when the each, incrementally complex project finally worked - the light lit; the text showed up; the servo moved.
		- When I was 14yo I created a harmless computer virus and infected my own machine! It was awesome!
		- Andre: physical computing is like spells (magic), you can be a wizard by creating things, animating things. This idea that we can have a sense of wonder by giving life to "dumb" objects. It's very powerful! we can teach any subject through the lens of physical computing
		- Amira: we are bringing out the youth and kid in us with this topic!

- What needs, opportunities, and challenges do you see right now in providing learning resources about physical computing, especially as a gateway to Internet of Things?

- Andre: Access to devices is difficult (expensive) & teaching materials are not available in all languages. Everyone has phones - can we repurpose the tools we have? Put our creativity to use to make our own devices and resources. Need to increase this availability in many countries

- Jie: Magical that we can even have this conversation right now! How can we use that to leverage the exchange of information across time zones, spaces, etc. Share the idea, the spirit, and philosophy among the global community. How can we all share something (if not everything)

- Questions from the MoPad and chat.

		- What are examples of best practices/projects to get teachers/students trying out something with physical computing, across grade levels?
		- Where's the best place to start as a beginner? Are there some good pathways from beginner to intermediate to advanced?


3. 8:20 - 8:25 PM - Deciding on a project (or projects) we can prototype together while thinking-aloud online, or deciding to split and team-up on several smaller projects. 

- Jie: A webpage or service that allows for asynchronous hangout-like interactions. A video-dialogue template or platform.

		- Imagine a Stack Overflow http://stackoverflow.com/ or other help page that uses video to share questions, answers, and feedback instead of text.
		- richness of a conversation without needing everyone to be present at the same time. Maybe just video as medium for conversation is interesting enough?

- Natalie: The Internet of Hugs <3

		- Using physical computing & internet to be able to interact with someone at a distance. For example, a little flag is lifted by someone across the globe when they are thinking of you! Create a toolkit to make this kind of connection easy. I wrote a little more on this here: http://www.nataliefreed.com/internet-of-hugs/
		- I love this idea as a way to connect people through IoT projects
		- I saw this Good Night Lamp recently - reminds me of this: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/designswarm/good-night-lamp oh oh, so good! I can see families being connected and using the lamp (aka I can see my mom wanting it)I'm a mom and I want it ;)

- Andre: Hacking on mobile devices

		- Create experiment: from phone into device. Ex: when you receive a tweet the device will do X. We should encourage use of things that are already in your home and connect them via mobile device

- Prototype Q: Create a kit/support mechanism focusing on Internet of Hugs using common home items?

		- What tech would we need to make this possible? What materials? How can we make it economical? +!



4. 8:25 - 8:50 PM - Sprinting on projects. During this time, though we'll begin prototyping on this etherpad, we might also screenshare and use GDocs or coding tools like Thimble or Scratch or anything participants bring to the table to sketch or prototype projects. The emphasis will be on talking with one another about the work so viewers can watch and listen to the process of curriculum and learning material 

- GDoc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FefSUsTG348KjvTRvynLmlw-jz74c_DBHtflcI0EVyo/edit?usp=sharing

- Episode repo: https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/curriculum-workshop/tree/master/april-12-2016

- Discussion notes:

- Lots of barriers here: 

		- People don't know how to "compute"/program
		- Language
		- Illiterate

- Kit you can use without programming? Little Bits http://littlebits.cc Good first kit to "get you hooked"

- Circuit Stickers? chibitronics.com

		- stickers that are flexible circuit boards (LED lights, sensors, micro controller) adhesive that sticks to object and creates connection. Feels like you are doing arts and crafts but also building electronic pieces. You can make it your own and that is when the learning really starts to click

- Where is a good place for someone to start to bring physical computing into the classroom?

		- Jie: Connect 1 LED:1 battery for the 1st time is really exciting! Initial success is surprising for many and a good hook to get people interested/excited. If you limit the # of materials encourages exploration without being overwhelming

- What pathways do people take from beginner to intermediate to expert?

		- Natalie: resources don't work for every student - many resources go from example to "do this". Build things up in logical steps to help those that don't immediately get the connection. Also opens the door for more experimentation. Provide some structure and guidance but don't limit creativity!
		- Andre: IoT lab - robotics with scrap material. Encouraged to build stuff with stuff destined to junk bin. If it didn't work, oh well! It was a powerful structure. We weren't afraid to experiment and make mistake.
		- Jie: Some of the best learning moments are when you are really frustrated! How can we support this way of learning?
		- Chad: consistently encouraged over the course of a year with 8th graders and saw comfort come over time as a group. Dynamic/culture gets better with this (while not necessarily with individual students) - "Of Coding and Compassion" - www.slj.com/2016/04/technology/of-coding-and-compassion/
		- Transforming traditional items into interactive items. I remember creating a corsage (at Maker Prom!) through led lights and tissue paper 
		- Breaking things is fun!


5. 8:50 - 9:00 PM - Sharing prototypes and reflections on the sprint.

- Check out the repo at line 61 to find tonight's materials in one place (look later this week).

- How can we continue the Internet of Hugs work with a consensus kit, facilitation guide, and handbook for introductory assemblies and code.


6. 9:00 PM - Final thoughts, ways to keep in touch, and good-byes.

- Thanks for everyone you participated in the discussion! 

		- Natalie: We don't talk/connect enough! Really cool to do mentorship with this type of topic
		- Jie: Why don't we do this more often! Agree with Natalie - there are a lot of people that are excited about this topic and we need to continue the discussion!
		- Andre: 5 hour physical computing workshop! Discourse topics work too. Let's continue to discuss.
		- Chad: Thanks to everyone for the work!

- Questions from viewers
