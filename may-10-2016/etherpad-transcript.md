**Youth Civic Engagement**

**1. 10:00 - 10:10 AM - Introductions to the show, our on-air participants, and their work.**

- Rafranz Davis, Executive Director of Professional and Digital Learning Lufkin ISD and speaker on STEM education, teacher voice, digital equity, and diversity in ed tech, http://rafranzdavis.com/ 
- Her work is centered on empowering voices, especially those in marginalized communities. 

- Jeremy Dean, Director of Education at Hypothes.is, and open annotation platform for collaborating, discussion, organizing, and research on the web, https://hypothes.is/ 
- Former HS and college teacher
- Amplifying voice is important and using tools like Hypothes.is is important for empowerment. Having young people talk back to candidates on their policy pieces is a great way to engage.

- D.C. Vito, Executive Director of the LAMP (Learning About Media Project), a media literacy program dedicated to fostering critical, positive, and thriving citizenship, http://thelamp.org/
- Creating a way for students to explore the 3 Cs: comprehend, create, challenge
- http://thelamp.org/portfolio/media-breaker/

**2. 10:10 - 10:20 AM - Questions & Answers**

- What are your favorite examples of local and global youth civic engagement and leadership projects? if your organization participates in the National Writing Project's Letters to the Next President campaign, this is a chance to describe the campaign and your work there, as well. Audience members, please add your favorite projects and links below!
-       Rafranz: a Club in her community is centered around the election but they understand that it's not just the presidential election. The kids are seeing the magnitude of impact depending on who wins/loses. 
-       Julia: Really love this project called Changemakers - a collab between a couple organizations in NYC. "harness the power of social media to bolster youth-led social justice campaigns through the development of grassroots organizing skills and creative media strategies." http://hivenyc.wpengine.com/portfolio/changemakers/
-       Julia: Another fave of mine is Youth Bike Summit in St. Paul, MN. "Youth Bike transforms our local communities and strengthens our national movement by empowering bicycle leaders." https://youthbikesummit.org/
-       Amira: A newer example is Girl Govern in Chicago - here's a description on what they are doing: Through trainings in citizen journalism, our project will empower girls and young women to become active in civic leadership, thus amplifying their voices and concerns. we will conduct media trainings (both online and in person) and hold public forums to encourage young women to understand the issues.
-       DC: Breakathon in a box is a great way to engage with free-to-use materials http://thelamp.org/portfolio/media-breaker/
-       Also, here's a link to The LAMP's Break the Election landing page: http://thelamp.org/break-the-election-2016/
-       Jeremy: seeing young people use rap genius to engage in public discussion, even regarding elections and civic movement www.rapgenius.com
-       (for example, kids annotating the SOTU every year, both in classrooms and out, using rapgenius.com)
-       (but also kids just annotating their favorite rap music and getting into debates with each other about the meaning/politics of the language)
-       Used to work with this great group in Oakland: Educating For Democracy in the Digital Age: http://eddaoakland.org/
-       Here's a great webinar with educators sharing what they learned from this project: http://educatorinnovator.org/webinars/educators-experiences-educating-for-participatory-politics/
-       Philadelphia Student Union: http://phillystudentunion.org/+1
-       Letters to the Next President: http://letters2president.org/+1
-       SPARK hackathon: http://spark.stab.org/
-       Antero: I've been interested in the role that games can play in youth civic engagement. Here's an attempt at integrating geocaching into electoral dialogue back in 2012: http://civicmediaproject.org/works/civic-media-project/racetothewhitehouse
-       Hana: Youth Minds Advocacy in SF does great work with youth to change mental health policy
-       Global Action Project in NYC: works with youth organizing groups around the country to create media that support their campaigns www.global-action.org
-       Radio Rookies: http://www.wnyc.org/shows/rookies/ +100< good one!
-       Project Justice: http://projectjustice.wikispaces.com/Home (my own little home-grown effort to introduce  MS students to advocacy)
-       Off/Page Project - spoken word mixed with investigative reporting: http://youthspeaks.org/offpage/

- What does the web bring to youth civic engagement projects and leadership opportunities? Audience members, what do you think?
-       Jeremy - web 2.0, still compelling in the classroom, youth is engaging via annotating publicly. Youth have a lot of new opportunities (with an audience) that were not available not long ago and they are utilizing it which is great. It can be scary, but great opportunity
-       Uses rapgenius.com and hypothes.is in the classroom
-       DC: At the end of workshops, we wanted to create something that was a simple barrier-free entry into the conversation (and free). Schools block youtube, so we wanted a place where students can remix video without restriction
-       Rafranz: There are so many resources that exist that we don't know about it! The ones that are used and the most talked about and opportunities are missed because of visibility. Sharing these resources and explaining how they can be used is important. 
-       The use of social media has been powerful for youth (Ferguson protests, for ex) while not as deep of a platform
-       let's say it together: C-O-M-M-U-N-I-T-Y!
-       Julia: Access to information and examples of what likeminded people are doing around the world. The web allows young people to be more informed on topics that interest them. It also allows them to connect to each other, provide support and share  
-       Distribution/syndication of core content, projects, voices?

-  Audience question(s)
-       Caro: When I worked with teenagers in marginalized communities in Colombia the biggest challenge was their apathy. There were tools, media, resources but they just didn’t feel they could do anything about their future, lives… How do you address this? how do you motivate and engage?
-       Chad: how do we create inclusive spaces that allow for safe spaces that make youth comfortable sharing their ideas on public platforms (on such heated issues)
-       Rafranz is highlighting (for me) how important leadership and a nuanced vision is for sustaining inclusion. Just because things are online doesn't mean they are necessarily equitable or inviting. The ongoing damage illustrated by things like gamergate should be a warning here. #educolor FTW.
-       Rafranz: A lot of platforms, movements require inclusivity, like #educolor. A lot of schools are including student voices in their work and planning. It is becoming more and more clear in the work and the community itself
-       DC: Media Breaker was in reaction to the problem that students can record freely with copyrighted material. When you are not encouraged to take on copyrighted material, you don't want to touch it. Fair use is key to participate in the discussion, but it is not an inclusive environment. We have support from lawyers but what are students supposed to do? That's why we created media breaker. No one sees your work except you and the students, so it's a safe environment (not nasty youtube comments or take down notices from lawyers)
-       Jeremy:  This is a pressing issue online and one that needs to be addressed and we take it seriously. There are great tools, but the worry is that not all youth have access to them. Internet connections, mobile capability can be obstacles. 
-       Question from Christina: How do we make http://letters2president.org/ fully accessible and inclusive? Interested in thoughts on that as it is an opportunity to leverage the election and speak back to what's happening in political and media spaces
-       I love the idea DC just talked about "Media Breaker studio". Create a closed space for learners and participants to freely voice what they are thinking. (hypothes.is also has private groups for annotation on the web) +1
-       Rafranz: Unless teachers teach a government course, they shy away from the topic because it can be cause for suspension. The safe entry point is the National Writing Project campaign (Letters to Next President) but you must do it without judgement on the students and the views they share.
-       teachers need to know that our belief isn't the students belief and we must respect all answers.+1 create a club that the parents can join!That's an interesting idea!+1 ask parents to be involved in the process
-       This election cycle has made it really difficult to manage the tension, but it's still important to create a safe space+1
-       Love this Edutopia article by Ellen Shelton in Mississippi -- focusing on strategies for how to support youth in tapping into topics that are important to them and the development of what she called a "purple party" http://www.edutopia.org/blog/letters-to-next-president-2point0-ellen-shelton
-       Jeremy: Letters 2 Next President is an interesting idea and is a way to put your ideas out there (which will likely have lots of disagreements because of how this election cycle is going). We need to educate students about what can happen online - the bad outcomes, comments, etc. - so they are prepared. They need to understand the potential for abuse in these conversations and how to handle it.
-       Chad - do you have codes of conducts you can share? See line 127
-       Rafranz: Talking about civic engagement/social justice is new and has no precedent from the past. There is a lot of fear because of potential of what can happen if we engage in the classroomThis piece about the community is really important. Another thing to notice is that many kids need to talk about the election because they are scared. There have been several articles on this recently ...

**3. 10:20 - 10:25 AM - Deciding on a project (or projects) we can prototype together.**

- From Antero in the chat: "The signal and noise of resources used in schools is a real issue: there are a lot of not-so-great tools being foisted on educators."
- "Solving" trolls when publishing student work. (balancing public work with safety issues.)
- Mobile prototyping; lo-fi, no-fi access/iterations.
- Rafranz: how do we, youth, get started with civic engagement at home and in the world?
- As a youth, my parent is my voice, so here is what you need to know and say - awesome perspective!!!
- Rafranz: "what would a student-focused toolkit look like?"
- DC - students get excited when there is a bit of "danger" or the potential to rile things up a bit. Framing this to the students can help attract students
- Rafranz: That fear and danger can (and does) inhibit use in schools from teachers
- Jeremy: It's a powerful leveraging tool to get students involved - it's about something bigger. Being Savvy and having knowledge about how to use the tools in a way that is effective and safe is important.


**4. 10:25 - 10:50 AM - Sprinting on prototypes and projects.**

**5. 10:50 - 11:00 AM - Sharing prototypes and reflections on the sprint.**






**6. 11:00 AM - Final thoughts, ways to keep in touch, and good-byes.**

- Jeremy - Letters to Next President is an awesome campaign with great resources. It's a crazy, scary election year but it is a great opportunity to engage and instruct youth. Get involved!
-  stump speech annotatathon: https://hypothes.is/stump-speech-annotatathon/ +1
-  Would be cool to see if we could do the text AND the video of the speeches.
-  +1: or transcripts of ads annotated alongside remixed videos
-  DC: If we teach and engage the youth at a young age, it solidifies the process even more. Great resources to use.
-  Rafranz: Creating a space to truly empower your students to use tools/resources without judgement is key. Local elections and activism is just as important as presidential election. It's part of our civic duty to be involved at all levels - we need to help them find their voice now so they can find it later
-  Amira: involving students from the ground process and shaping what they want to do is important (and involving parents)
