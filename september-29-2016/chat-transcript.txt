Kristina:10:48 We need a tie breaker!

Coretta :10:48 Guide or goggles

Greg:10:50 or its in an lms and students lose access immediatley

Greg:10:50 or students lose materials behind lms as soon as class is over

Amira:10:50 I think it's more the former in this case

Kristina:10:50 Prototyping on line 110 - join in!

Randy Macdonald:10:51 +1 on the licensing tag :-)

Coretta :10:54 Delivered online via videos/animated

Coretta :10:54 Delivered in small groups in person

Amira:10:54 That would be fun to watch!

Randy Macdonald:10:55 When is the right time to share? At what point in a project?

Coretta :10:56 Will do!

Amira:10:56 @randy at the beginning

Karen:10:57 This may already exist, but is there is a curated and well organized wiki or other publication that brings basic info/questions together?

chadsansing:10:57 We should look for this! I like the Creative Commons site, too -

Karen:10:57 Do we need to make one?

Amira:10:58 I like the way you think Karen

Karen:10:58 :-)

Kristina:10:59 Great call everyone! Thanks for joining!

Coretta :10:59 Yes! I'll share this Oct. info

chadsansing:10:59 Thank you so much, everyone! You made this a great episode.

Coretta :11:00 This has been great. still getting used to Etherpad : )

Randy Macdonald:11:00 I agree that sharing works best at beginning, but I worry that students might be overwhelmed in the beginning with outside feedback

Greg:11:01 In my expericne: the feedback doesn't come and b if it does students are stoked

Coretta :11:01 Awesom Phillip!

Randy Macdonald:11:01 Great point Greg.

Amira:11:02 More info on coderdojo: https://coderdojo.com/

Brenda:11:02 thank you Chad & Amira for a great and insightful conversation

Randy Macdonald:11:02 Good point Amira, we need to model good practice to our students.

chadsansing:11:02 @Brenda - too kind! Guests and audience carried the day as usual - so grateful :)

Coretta :11:03 Thanks to Amira ,Chad & all speakers!

Christie:11:03 https://cbahlai.github.io/rqm-template/

Christie:11:04 Thanks all! Great chatting with you!

Randy Macdonald:11:04 Love to see this guide come to fruition. Is there a plan to host a working version somewhere?

Mark Shillitoe:11:04 Thanks everyone

Greg:11:05 lets make a creative commons teaching kits

Amira:11:05 Thank you!

Amira:11:05 See everyone next month :)

Randy Macdonald:11:06 Great workshop, thanks all. :-)

Greg:11:06 these quick prototypes should be the brainstorming for the stuff the community would work on for a month and then review.

Karen:11:06 Where & how do we take next steps on a resource thingie?

Dhruv:11:06 Hii just missed the session!

chadsansing:11:07 Let's talk format sometime soon, @Greg & other interested people. Fostering a long-tail of making from these brainstorms is a goal we're still working towards. Looking forward to the guide w/ Code Dojp, as well, @Philip!

Amira:11:07 Perhaps drop more comments in the pad. And if you're interested in collaborating on resources, chad and philip might be creating something

Karen:11:07 Chad, I'm interested in resource-making

Coretta :11:08 I'd like to help...

Greg:11:08 aagree Karen we use the synch calls, but then we fit in a protype in the first sprint of the month, a revision in second sprint, and then share on next call

Greg:11:09 or heartbeat, I can nenevr remeber the difference

Greg:11:10 I was talking to @soapdog, and we thought videos inthe "plain english genre" would be great because audio could be stripped . easy for l10n

Karen:11:10 Love that idea

steve:11:11 Thanks for all the insight concerning copyrights and education. Looking forward to seeing any guides or other resources coming from this. Also feel free to contact me if you want any reviewers.

Greg:11:11 Hey Hannah, didn't see you drop in

Karen:11:11 @Greg would be great to have kids/teachers work on that

steve:11:11 unnamed===steve

Greg:11:11 Agree, its so paper based, low tech a great intro video genre

Mehul:11:11 Hey,

Greg:11:14 from teh start learn out loud

Greg:11:14 Hey Amira could we make an open course using teachable? that could be an idea

chadsansing:11:15 Okay - let's set up a time for follow up. In the interest of privacy for everyone, please email me at chad at mozillafoundation dot org or send me a DM on twitter with your preferred contact info. Sound okay? I'll start looking at our open science and leadership resources, as well.

Mehul:11:15 What if anyone wants to share their story and need any help so how they can communicate ?

Greg:11:19 or something

Greg:11:19 @chadsasing been working on the open leadership curriculum on the other participation side as well...trying to bring projects together.
