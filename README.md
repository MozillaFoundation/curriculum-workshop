# curriculum-workshop
This is a repo hosting products, projects, and prototypes spinning out of the [Mozilla Curriculum Workshop](https://teach.mozilla.org/community/curriculum-workshop/) webcast.

On the workshop, co-hosts Amira Dhalla and Chad Sansing, along with producer Paul Oh, help participants answer the question, "How can I use the web to teach and learn whatâ€™s important to me?"

Participants, viewers, and community members of all sorts are welcome to fork and extend the work hosted here. We look forward to seeing what kinds of teaching and learning materials we can create together!

Not sure how to begin? Sign up for a GitHub account and comment on a piece of work here using the "Issues" tab near the upper left-hand corner of the page. You can also join [a more wide-ranging discussion about the workshop](https://discourse.webmaker.org/c/mozilla-curriculum-workshop) on Discourse, our public forum.
