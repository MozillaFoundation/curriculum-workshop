##Physical Computing Episode

On our April episode of the Mozilla Curriculum Workshop, Jeremy Boggs, Natalie Freed, Andre Garzia, and Jie Qi will help us understand physical computing as a gateway into the Internet of Things (IoT), the network of connected devices embedded in everyday objects. An in-depth episode on IoT will follow this summer. Viewers can add to the discussion and help us prototype web-native teaching and learning materials about physical computing by participating in our etherpad and chat.
