Paul Zenke:09:28 Hi Chad!

chadsansing:09:30 Awesome to have you!

Paul Zenke:09:34 Thanks for inviting me. I apologize in advance. I might be somewhat of a lurker today. Sorry, I'm double booked this morning. But I look forward to observing the process and learning more about your work!

jlin:10:03 hi!

Amira:10:03 Hey unnamed - feel free to update your name in the top right of the etherpad

shahul hameed:10:03 hi

chadsansing:10:04 Greetings!

chadsansing:10:12 Hello, wonderful audience members! Please add your name at the top of the chat roll and in the roll call at line 18.

Maryann:10:12 "they don't know what they don't know" is absolutely where it's at.

Amira:10:12 Maryann want to add that to the etherpad on line 46?

Maryann:10:12 take the obligation off EVERYONE that it's intuitive that we all know this. It's important work to be done

Maryann:10:13 thank A! I will. I am a librarian.. I write stuff down!!!

Paul Oh:10:14 Maryann - also, please add your name and location on line 28!

Paul Oh:10:14 Now line 29 :-)

June:10:16 thanks for organizing

chadsansing:10:19 Great to have you with us, June!

Paul Oh:10:19 Any questions for the guests?

chadsansing:10:19 Please add your name next to the colored square at the top of the chat if you haven't yet and add yourself to the roll call at line 18.

chadsansing:10:23 If you see "unnamed" at the top of this column, that's where you can add your name :)

Maryann:10:33 I am a librarian. And we treat the topic of privacy as a literacy

Paul Oh:10:34 Love that notion, Maryann

Paul Oh:10:34 Can you say more?

chadsansing:10:34 Cool - is there a definition or resource of privacy literacy you especially like and can share on the pad?

Maryann:10:34 we are fortunate to have people in a mindset of learning for personal growth... and security. So I feel lucky that children and adults can come to a place confidentially to learn this as surely as they 'learn to read'

Maryann:10:34 ... I want to add to the etherpad..but it was being buggy.. sorry! --- it's compatible with firefox right????

Maryann:10:34 ;)

chadsansing:10:36 Should be - but with a lot of activity, it can be buggy on individual machines depending on connections :)

chadsansing:10:48 It took forever for me to be allowed to watch Start Trek II.

June:10:58 love that No Grownup left behind, need to use it

Amira:10:58 I know...so good!

Amira:10:59 It's not good enough. I loved when Cynthia said it's not good enough to say my child knowns more than me

Vishal Chavan:11:00 That quote is very true in recent times

Amira:11:01 Thanks everyone! great call

Vishal Chavan:11:01 Looking forward to the next time we all meet

chadsansing:11:02 Thank you, All - goodbye!

Maryann:11:05 thanks
