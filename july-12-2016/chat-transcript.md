**chadsansing** *10:43* Takes me right back to Geoguessr.

**chadsansing** *10:43* Also - Pokemon GO or Pokemon NO, #amiright?

**Ani :** *10:45* lol oh dear ok ty

**Greg jgmac1106:** *10:45* That is one thing we are not really addressing is video. When I talk to kids about digital lives they inherently mean video

**Greg jgmac1106:** *10:46* way more than the sliver who think code

**chadsansing** *10:46* We can ask a follow up about how video shows up.

**Kenyatta:** *10:46* hahahaha ani!

**Amira:** *10:48* so deep

**Greg jgmac1106:** *10:49* I like activities like just building your about me page

**Greg jgmac1106:** *10:49* thimble projects often show up pretty high in search results if you link to them once or twice

**Amira:** *10:49* true story

**Amira:** *10:50* if you're lost in the pad (and don't know where to drop answers) come join me on line 137

**Greg jgmac1106:** *10:50 If only there was a tool that let you easily remix html5 video and remix it wioth other clips, audio, and images

**Greg jgmac1106:** *10:51* I miss tools like Zeega
