# March 8th Prototyping Document - Mentorship Resource

From the MoPad at https://teach.mozilla.org/community/curriculum-workshop/: 

	How could a mentor in tech relay to a young girl a project they are doing and ask for feedback? Project based or solution based? Need framework to guide and setup for success. What does this look like?

What if we had a place where mentors could share case studies with a discussion form for individuals to contribute ideas and collaborate on solutions? I’m thinking a Discourse like medium that would allow for easy discussion? 

Chris says: what if industry mentors produced assets for use quicker, like case studies for analysis, design frameworks, code

## RUBRIC?
How do we create expectations for a mentor/student relationship? *Should there be expectations or does that stymie creativity/productivity? (Ingrid): It’s critical to set up mentors with the right awareness of the group of students you want to engage/set up a mentee/collaboration. That takes relationship building and providing context to the mentor and also with student mentees. Another great way to kick off the relationship is having each mentor and mentee share a set of challenges or prompts in personal story format. Helpful to dive right into personal storytelling and community building, which builds an opportunity for meaningful engagement between the mentor and mentee.*

Helpful Link to Document we have created for instructors/industry leaders to focus on [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WR_igflFTi1bTbZmV06i1rjRBZPGqWkNUVKdyyIwAMA/edit?usp=sharing+1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WR_igflFTi1bTbZmV06i1rjRBZPGqWkNUVKdyyIwAMA/edit?usp=sharing+1)

Expectations for a mentor/student relationship:

Do

- Create a comfortable environment that allows individuals to share ideas openly
- Understand that feedback and learning goes both ways
- Understand how to support each other
- Allow them to embrace their mistakes as learning experiences +1 (Laira)
- Be patient with mentee; don’t expect them to understand a new concept the first time or the manner in which you explain it. If you get stuck, collaborate with another mentor.
- (GitHub?) 
- Be connected
- Help mentee make a connection between what they are learning and how it is used in the real-world. 
- Set expectations of each party - know collective goals
- Face-to-face but can be supported via online

Don’t

- Share your experience, but don’t do it for them. Help mentee get to the answers to their questions quicker.
- (Don’t) assume that something is too hard for a student to accomplish. Sometimes in trying to align students with projects we can underestimate them

How can we help connect mentors with interested students/participants? Look up local networks? forums? See this as specifically an issue in rural areas (perhaps?)
I recruit adult volunteers frequently to OUSD, but mostly for short-term engagements. I wonder if there needs to be additional steps for someone who wants to take things on long-term.
	A. relationship building within the industry relevant to your area of focus 
	B. attending meet-ups, related webinars, Linkedin networks 
	connecting with HR, People Department, Diversity at larger companies who are seeking mentor/mentee opportunities for employees, whether that is part of their volunteership program or Corporate Social 
	C. Responsibility effort (Ingrid).
