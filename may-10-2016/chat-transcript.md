**Antero:** *10:06* Chad!

**chadsansing:** *10:06* :)

**Paul:** *10:06* Hey Antero!

**Rafranz:** *10:06* Hi Antero!

**Antero:** *10:07* Hi everyone!

**Jeremy Dean:** *10:09* More about hypothes.is /EDU

**Jeremy Dean:** *10:09*  https://hypothes.is/education/

**Rafranz:** *10:09* This media breaker looks pretty amazing

**Antero:** *10:09* +1

**chadsansing:** *10:11* Please share your favorite youth civic engagement projects and resources beginning at line 28*  on the etherpad :)

**Antero:** *10:11* love that, Rafranz!

**Amira:** *10:13* http://thelamp.org/portfolio/media-breaker/

**Kristina:** *10:15* Is there a link to rap genius that you can share?

**Antero:** *10:15* Definitely agree with Jeremey that we need to consider what "counts" as civic engagement. Mimi Ito talks about "big P" and "little p" participation in this regards.

**Jeremy Dean:** *10:15* thumbs up

**Jeremy Dean:** *10:15* rapgenius.com

**Kristina:** *10:15* Thanks!

**Christina :** *10:18* Hello everyone! I am hearing an echo.

**Paul:** *10:19* Hi Christina - I think it may be an issue with your equipment.

**Paul:** *10:19* It's sounding pretty good to most of us.

**Christina :** *10:20* It stopped. It was during the end of Jeremy and most of DC.

**Christina :** *10:21* Rafranz sounds fine.

**Paul:** *10:21* Ok, great!

**Jeremy Dean:** *10:21* hypthes.is works in the same as genius's offsite annotation tool

**Jeremy Dean:** *10:21 https://hypothes.is/

**Antero:** *10:21* The signal and noise of resources used in schools is a real issue: there are a lot of not-so-great tools being foisted on educators.

**Amira:** *10:21* Antero - how do we change this?

**chadsansing:** *10:22* I sense a prototype here.

**Antero:** *10:22* Chad, do you smell what the etherpad is cooking??

**chadsansing:** *10:22* Always.

**Paul:** *10:22* I would suggest checking out EDDA which is school-based.

**Paul:** *10:23* Line 37* 

**Kristina:** *10:24* Hey all, don't forget that you can add to the conversation in the etherpad at any time. We'd love your thoughts on the discussion and to hear any resources you can add to the list

**Amira:** *10:24* #educolour movement

**Amira:** *10:24* d'oh....too canadian for my own good! #educolor

**Christina :** *10:25* :)

**Christina :** *10:26*  How do we make http://letters2president.org/ fully accessible and inclusive? Interested in thoughts on that as it is an opportunity to leverage the election and speak back to what's happening in political and media spaces

**Jeremy Dean:** *10:28*  here's the hypothes.is portal to L2P2.0 resources:

**Jeremy Dean:** *10:28*  https://hypothes.is/letters-to-the-next-president/

**chadsansing:** *10:28*  Takeaway from Rafranz: check for content that is not inclusive; involve students in decision-making, making the work relevent..

**Amira:** *10:28*  thx jeremy

**Amira:** *10:29*  I love that example of uptown funk remixed to be uptown cat call!

**Kristina:** *10:30 +1

**Amira:** *10:31* @christina - we're a bit behind in the schedule so I put your question in the etherpad at line 63 and we can encourage people to answer there

**Antero:** *10:34* oh yeah, STUDENTS!!! :)

**chadsansing:** *10:35* +1000

**Kristina:** *10:39*  Drop your thoughts and resources into the prototyping list starting at 8* 1!

**chadsansing:** *10:44* Antero, bring some resource noise to the pad :)

**Amira:** *10:48*  Monica L article https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016* /apr/16* /monica-lewinsky-shame-sticks-like-tar-jon-ronson

**Christina :** *10:49*  Thinking about the way we make community guidelines for L2P 2.0 ... good point.

**Christina :** *10:51 We know the focus is on topics and issues and not candidates ...

**Christina :** *10:51 ... and I think we could talk through what else needs to be part of the shared community we develop together.

**Amira:** *10:52* examples of code of conducts at line 127* 

**Christina :** *10:52* Common Sense is a great resource.

**Ani:** *10:54* hell yea
