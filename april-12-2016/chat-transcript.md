**chadsansing:** *20:19* Just taking a moment to re-forward the invitation to ask questions here and on the etherpad itself - would love to hear from you!

**chadsansing:** *20:21* Questions can be of any sort for us and/or our guests - much <3, audience!

**Andre:** *20:22* Lets Go Meta!!! :D Love to have more tooling

**Paul:** *20:25* Hey friends: Chad's going to pose the question that's on line 41 - and any others that come up, during the prototyping.

**chadsansing:** *20:34* I'll have the doc open in a moment :)

**Kim Wilkens:** *20:35* It would also be great to know what level of experience?

**chadsansing:** *20:35* Please reload the doc and then you should be able to edit!

**Paul:** *20:36* Kim - can you say a little more about your question?

**Kim Wilkens:** *20:37* where's the best place to start as a beginner? are there some good pathways from beginner to intermediate to advanced

**Paul:** *20:37* ah, got it - thanks!

**Andre:** *20:37* LOVED THEM!!!! NEED WANT!!! :D

**Paul:** *20:38* circuit stickers are amazing - so fun

**Kim Wilkens:** *20:38* adafruit has some great tutorials, but I got in over my head with one of their projects, so would love something that helps build up to the big project

**Natalie:** *20:38* What project are you working on? (the Adafruit one)

**Amira:** *20:39* Kim do you have a link to share?

**Kim Wilkens:** *20:40* https://learn.adafruit.com/gemma-led-sneakers/overview

**Kim Wilkens:** *20:40* I finally have one completed after many months:)

**Amira:** *20:41* Ooo going to investigate

**Kim Wilkens:** *20:44* Natalie - that's exactly what happened to me with the sneaker project

**chadsansing:** *20:45* Yes - LED + coin bettery + tape = ultimate beginner swag pack.

**Chris Lawrence:** *20:46* i had to step away, but was going to say led/battery is so powerful

**Paul:** *20:46* I also found when i first lit up a circuit sticker that a powerful aspect of the work was the connection to other everyday matierals like a notebook, pen, and paper

**Kim Wilkens:** *20:47* Seems like there are lots of great starter project & then enticing advanced projects, but not alot of scaffolding to get from one to the other
