Special thanks to Ricardo Vazquez and Teachers Teaching Teachers for editoductions to the show, our on-air participants, and their work.

- Ingrid Dahl works at Bay Area Video Coalition. Just launched young women's leaders fellowship program called bridges: https://www.bavc.org/youth-programs/bridges-fellowship
- Claire Shorall leads computer science position at a school in Oakland
- Kim Wilkens founder of tech-girls that runs programs for girls in Kindergarten to High School

Does the audience have any questions?

**2. 8:10 - 8:20 PM** - Sharing needs for web-native teaching and learning materials about womenâ€™s accomplishments, rights, and issues.

What is it that we need to do differently to teach women and girls? (Amira's question)

- Don't pinkify (Claire)
- Good teaching practices are good teaching practices (Claire)
- Giving girls a safe space where they feel comfortable in making mistakes and talking with each other (Laira) 
- Co-hort based learning (Ingrid) - coming together as a group that experiences everything together

What's working on the web and what needs still exist? (Chad's question)

- Outsourcing teaching to the web is powerful but we need educators in the classroom to be able to take blended learning into spaces
- Open source software is working! So is meetups!
- Depending upon what you are interested in, the web has communities for you

**3. 8:20 - 8:25 PM** - Deciding on a project (or projects) we can prototype together while thinking-aloud online, or deciding to split and team-up on several smaller projects. 

- Ingrid: Getting media and CS professionals to give feedback on student products so that the girl can see the kinds of decisions they can take both in developing their projects and their careers.+1 i love this. Curiosity Machine has a great model with scientists and students http://curiositymachine.org/
- Kim: Recommended videos on YouTube don't contain enough women - check out #womencreate hashtag on YouTube.  Platform for finding what you can create with tech and then share that creation.
- Claire: Research in Action project for High School students - would love to make technology related to this project (ex. structural oppression within schools). Projects that girls my be interested in are beyond scope of what they do in the classroom - what we can do to help mentor/inspire/understand the breadth of opportunity

**BIG IDEA:** How could a mentor in tech relay to a young girl a project they are doing and ask for feedback?
- Project based or solution based? Need framework to guide and setup for success. What does this look like?
- Google Doc: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/13poudr6Tpg6dJBZHCNB1hk0a7egGaRAmsAQWgb4vQTU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13poudr6Tpg6dJBZHCNB1hk0a7egGaRAmsAQWgb4vQTU/edit?usp=sharing)

**Ideas/Qs from the Chat:**

- How can YouTube screencast/recording help?
	- (Claire) Can watch students talk through questions, learning is organic as it happens naturally, kids need internet access both at home and at school
	- Look up "Lets play" online to find examples, although sometimes it is difficult to share when participants are under 18
- What are the issues facing urban vs rural areas? What are the opportunities?
	- Ingrid: Urban areas have more issues with this than you think. A lot of it relies on networking and pinpointed marketing. In rural areas, freelancers can be key, comfortable using google hangout (for example)
	- Claire: differences in face-to-face vs email/chat is accepted by different individuals with a variety of responses. Face-to-face always seem to be better and strengthens relationships.
- What if industry mentors produced assets for use quicker, like case studies for analysis, design frameworks, code?
- Can we create a resource to help people who might be "mentor curious"?

**4. 8:25 - 8:50 PM** - Sprinting on projects. During this time, we might screenshare and use GDocs or coding tools like Thimble or Scratch or anything participants bring to the table to sketch or prototype projects. The emphasis will be on talking with one another about the work so viewers can watch and listen to the process of curriculum and learning material design on-air.

**5. 8:50 - 9:00 PM** - Sharing prototypes and reflections on the sprint.

- Kim: The more we can facilitate getting girls interested in tech and helping them see real-world applications, the better
- Claire: CS - Connecting women in tech with young women learners - there are so many opportunities
- Ingrid: 3 great resources on this workshop! Happy to share emails and will gladly accept and share mentors!
- Chad: Great discussion and lots of places to go - thanks for all of the mentorship that was happening to make this workshop happen
- Amira: How can we connect these girls in a way that is applicable and powerful? Will continue to think this over!

**6. 9:00 PM** - Final thoughts, ways to keep in touch, and good-byes.

- Julia: this was great. Very excited to hear from everyone and see where these ideas may land. I am @colorwheelz and work @hivelearningnyc
